# Functions to run transformations
# There are two distinct functions to transform two flavors of operators.
#   1. Full Operators are the operators as loaded directly from the list
#       of operatores. These operators use a single supplied molecule for all
#       "Any" instances in the rule.
#   2. Partial operators are operators for reactions with more than one
#       "Any" in the reactants. These rules are derived from individually
#       mapped reactions and are called partial because only one "Any" is
#       allowed to be novel, the other "Any"s are determined by the
#       mapped reactions.

# Both operators are preprocessed slightly differently, but yield the same
# output format back to the pickaxe object.
